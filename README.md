# Youtube to MP3 with Python
Needed to download some audios but there are too many sketchy youtube-to-mp3 web apps out there so decided to just make my own...

Just s simple program that asks you to enter a youtube link and it extracts the MP3 for you to download. It uses the [youtube_dl](https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/) module.

If you want a more refined program to manage your YouTube downloads I recommend you check out the [youtube_dl command-line program](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl).
